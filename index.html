<a id="indices-and-types" class="anchor" href="#indices-and-types" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Indices and types</h3>

<p>Every time you store data in <em>Elasticsearch</em> it get's saved inside an <strong>index</strong> which has a <strong>type</strong>. compared to <em>MongoDB</em> an index is similar to a database, and a type similar to a collection. Compared to <em>SQL</em> an index would be like a database, and a type like a table.</p>

<p>convention: </p>

<pre><code>localhost:9200/index/type/
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Important note</strong> different types living in the same index cannot have the same field name with different config or field type</p>

<p>For example the following two documents can't co-exist since they share the same index, and both have a <em>city</em> attribute of different types, <em>string</em> and <em>object</em> respectively </p>

<pre><code>localhost:9200/test/users/1

{
    "city": "cityID123"
}

localhost:9200/test/city/1

{
    "city": {
        "name": "Toronto"
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When developing with elasticsearch there are 3 main steps we have to consider. <strong>Mapping</strong>, <strong>Indexing</strong>, and <strong>Querying</strong> data</p>

<h3>
<a id="1-mapping" class="anchor" href="#1-mapping" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1. Mapping</h3>

<p>Mapping is used to define how elastic should store and index a particular document and it's fields. </p>

<p>However if no mapping was introduced to a specific field on pre-index time, elastic will <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/dynamic-mapping.html">dynamically</a> add a <strong>generic</strong> type to that field. Although this may sound tempting, it is not! since generic types are very basic and do not meet queries expectations most of the time.</p>

<p>Moving forward with this tutorial we will base our examples on the following data schema: </p>

<pre><code>{
    "first_name": "bam",
    "last_name": "margera",
    "gender": "male",
    "age": 36
}
</code></pre>
